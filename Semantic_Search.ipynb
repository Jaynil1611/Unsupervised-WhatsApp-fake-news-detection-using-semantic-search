            "The Indian Railways had cancelled 99 trains on Wednesday night. (Express File Photo) The Indian Railways had cancelled 99 trains on Wednesday night. (Express File Photo)    In view of the coronavirus pandemic, all concessions in Indian Railways have been suspended for now, except concessions to students, patients and disabled, to discourage inessential travel. This means that all other train concessions, like senior citizens, farmers, war widows, VIPs, delegates, etc. stand suspended for now.    Earlier in the day, the officials said that the Railways had cancelled 84 more trains between March 20 to March 31. This takes the number of trains cancelled to 155.    WATCH | PM Modi appeals for ‘janata curfew’    “All passengers having tickets in cancelled trains are being informed about it individually. No cancellation fee will be taken for these trains. Passengers will get 100-per cent refund,” an official said. Follow Coronavirus outbreak LIVE updates    Indian Railways has cancelled 168 trains due to low occupancy in view of COVID19, from 20th March to 31st March. #Coronavirus pic.twitter.com/PHaQxCj2Wy — ANI (@ANI) March 19, 2020    Some of the trains cancelled are Pune-Jabalpur Special, Madgaon Express, LTT Nanded Express, Tadoba Express, New Delhi-Jabalpur Shridham Super Fast Express, Mumbai-Aurangabad Jan Shatabdi Express, Anand Vihar Terminal Gorakhpur Humsafar Express, Indore-Khajuraho Express, among others.    The Indian Railways had cancelled 99 trains on Wednesday night. The Western Central Railway and Northern Railway cancelled 11 trains each, while the South Central Railway and Northeast Frontier Railway cancelled 20 trains each on Wednesday. 32 trains were cancelled from Southern Railway, and five were cancelled from East Central Railway.    On Tuesday, the Railways had issued a set of guidelines to zonal railways for its catering staff stating no employee having fever, cough, runny nose or difficulty in breathing “should be deployed in the business of food handling on the Indian Railways”.    As a precautionary measure, most railway zones also increased the prices of their platform tickets to discourage large crowds.    The Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR) witnessed a drop in their passengers. Passengers on WR dropped by around eight lakh to 32.26 lakh on Tuesday, as compared to 40.75 lakh who travelled in trains on Monday. Similarly, CR saw a drop of about 10 lakh passengers, with 39 lakh travelling on Tuesday, as against 49 lakh on Monday.    Chief PRO of CR, Shivaji Sutar said, “We urge passengers to travel only in case of emergency. We have been carrying out various awareness drives for the same. The cost of platform tickets has also been increased to work as a deterrent.”    📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

            "A man and his son seen wearing masks Tuesday. (Photo: Prashant Nadkar) A man and his son seen wearing masks Tuesday. (Photo: Prashant Nadkar)    With a drop in occupancy on trains, both Central and Western Railway on Tuesday announced cancellations of several pairs of long distance trains on various intercity routes. CR cancelled 23 trains, while WR cancelled 10 until March 31 to restrict passenger movement as a precaution to curtail COVID-19.    Trains cancelled by CR include Deccan Express and Pragati Express on the Mumbai-Pune routes, as well as Nizamuddin-CSMT Rajdhani, plying between Mumbai and Delhi. Various passenger associations said this move will inconvenience passengers, while also pointing out that travel has not been fully curtailed, with several alternative trains available on the same route.    Nitin Parmar, a Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member said, “Despite two trains being cancelled on the Mumbai-Pune routes, there are various others available on the same route, such as Deccan Queen and Indrayani, among others. Those who have to travel can adjust to these trains.” He added that in the past two weeks, there has been a drop in the passengers travelling in the trains.    Similarly, WR cancelled 10 trains, including three pairs of Duranto to Delhi, Jaipur and Indore, along with Humsafar Express, heading from Mumbai to Jamnagar and Puri. A senior WR officer said, “The trains which had an occupancy of less than 20 per cent have been cancelled. We are looking at other trains and depending on further review will cancel more.”    According to Kamlesh Shah, former ZRUCC member, abrupt cancellations will cause inconvenience to those who had made plans, but these measures will help in containing the spread of the virus.    Apart from cancellation of long distance trains, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) cancelled 9,262 trips across the state on March 16, while between March 11 and 16, a total of 20,957 trips were cancelled.    On March 16 alone, about 348 trips between Mumbai, Pune and Aurangabad on their premium shivneri routes were cancelled as well. Officials from MSRTC attributed the cancellation to poor response from passengers and to restrict passenger movement.    📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(Photo: Prashant Nadkar)    With a drop in occupancy on trains, both Central and Western Railway on Tuesday announced cancellations of several pairs of long distance trains on various intercity routes. CR cancelled 23 trains, while WR cancelled 10 until March 31 to restrict passenger movement as a precaution to curtail COVID-19.    Trains cancelled by CR include Deccan Express and Pragati Express on the Mumbai-Pune routes, as well as Nizamuddin-CSMT Rajdhani, plying between Mumbai and Delhi. Various passenger associations said this move will inconvenience passengers, while also pointing out that travel has not been fully curtailed, with several alternative trains available on the same route.    Nitin Parmar, a Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member said, “Despite two trains being cancelled on the Mumbai-Pune routes, there are various others available on the same route, such as Deccan Queen and Indrayani, among others. Those who have to travel can adjust to these trains.” He added that in the past two weeks, there has been a drop in the passengers travelling in the trains.    Similarly, WR cancelled 10 trains, including three pairs of Duranto to Delhi, Jaipur and Indore, along with Humsafar Express, heading from Mumbai to Jamnagar and Puri. A senior WR officer said, “The trains which had an occupancy of less than 20 per cent have been cancelled. We are looking at other trains and depending on further review will cancel more.”    According to Kamlesh Shah, former ZRUCC member, abrupt cancellations will cause inconvenience to those who had made plans, but these measures will help in containing the spread of the virus.    Apart from cancellation of long distance trains, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) cancelled 9,262 trips across the state on March 16, while between March 11 and 16, a total of 20,957 trips were cancelled.    On March 16 alone, about 348 trips between Mumbai, Pune and Aurangabad on their premium shivneri routes were cancelled as well.
